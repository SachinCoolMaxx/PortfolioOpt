# PortfolioOpt
How to invest money in stocks
Portfolio Optimization basically tries to address the question - if one gives an amount to be invested in financial markets, what should be the structure of this investment, what are the stocks that we should select and in which proportions? I worked on this problem during my 5th semester and tried to come up with a model to which can help you to construct an optimal portfolio based on risk to return ratio minimization subject to a maximum constraint on relatedness of stocks.

Simulations and Experiments were performed using MATLAB. The final report concisely explains all the results obtained and the inferences.
